## HTML structure

The layout file includes a wrapper element with the class of .row and child columns.

#### Example:

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    Your content
  </div>
</div>
```

## Requirements

- The component does not include styles and relies on the project to use bootstrap.
- The component expects to be within in a wrapper element with the class container or something similar
